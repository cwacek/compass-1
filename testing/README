These are a set of scripts designed to makes sure that any 
changes I have made don't change the behavior of the original 
compass.py. test.sh will run a series of command line switches
at compass.py, and save the output in a series of named test 
files.
check.py will take two test names and compare the output
from those tests to see if they match.


Note: Sometimes a test will fail even though the output is correct
because the sorting works differently in my revised version and
elements with the same value don't always occur in the same order.
